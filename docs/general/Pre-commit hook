Pre-commit hook in node - JSHint

1. Install jshint from NPM:
    npm install jshint
2. Next create a .jshintrc file in your project if you don't already have one. e.g:https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc
3. Now install pre-commit module (and save it as a dev dependency):
    npm install pre-commit --save-dev
4. Next you will need to define the task (script) that will be run for JSHint in your package.json
    e.g: { "scripts": { "jshint": "jshint -c .jshintrc --exclude-path .gitignore ." } }
5. Then you register the scripts you want to be run pre-commit (also in package.json) e.g:
    "pre-commit": [ "jshint", "coverage", "etc" ]
6. This allows you to have more than just one check in your pre-commit workflow.
