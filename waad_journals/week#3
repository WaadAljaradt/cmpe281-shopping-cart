Week #3 :

Task#1 : change frontend from using angualrjs to nodejs 
In the first week we have implemented most of our frontend work using angularjs 
for rest api's implementations and rendering pages.

but after checking with professor Paul and discussion among the forntend team we have decided 
to re-implement our frontend and instead use nodejs for frontned implementations , restapis and rendering 

Task#2 Test ALl sing-up Scenarios and integrate it with backend

1- successful signup integration
I was able to complete flow frontend-backend of signup for our system with successful results as well as 
displaying a confirmation letter and redirecting to login page.

2- Signup Error messages display and keep entered data before 
In a false signup flow i was able to display warning messages that indicates the error as well keep the data
entered by the user before and display them again after a false signup attempt.
the data fields have been validated as well by patterns and required attributes.

3- test keep the data for the user after false signup attempt.

These test results are saved an a pdf document in front-end documents 

Task #3 product catalog implementation 

1- product catalog template
i prepared a product catalog template that will display each product with the attributes in our system that includes
img, name, discriptions and rating for this product as well the opportunity to add this product to cart.

2- rest api call to get products in a list of json object.
I created a fronend get restapi to fetch the products that need to be displayed in the product catalog 
with the appropriate data required 
 
Task #4 :display reviews and allow rating for products
after discussion with the team we decided to display reviews and rating as well as allow the user to 
review and rate a product after order. for now i have implemented displaying a reviews on a star form 
for each product

Task #5 :add to cart implementation 
1-I have implemented a post add to cart res api with the backend of a product with name,sku,qty details 
to be added in the user shopping cart.

Task #6 :testing plans for this week 
 testing product catalog and add to cart frontend-backend implementation 
 
Task#5: tasks to be completed this week
1- implement search tags res api for products catalog 
2- implement a product details page

difficulties : 
because we had to rebuild some of the things in our frontend we lost a bit of time but we managed to stay on track 
and this week to start with products catalog page at this point im working on improving the layout I'm trying 
to search how to display a quantity button that allows user to increment and decrement easily with a fancy UI 
I have not found a good resource therefore i will continue on that and once the backend 
are ready to integrate and test some of the desired flows for products catalog and add to cart
