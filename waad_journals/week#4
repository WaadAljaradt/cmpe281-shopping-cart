Week #4 :

Task#1 : Implement Pagination for products in catalog page 
I have implemented pagination to view 10 products per page and with four directions as appropriate (first,last
next , previous ) to go through the products. 


Task#2 Implement search functionality complete flow 

1- I have implemented Search for a text functionality that looks up products associated with a text
and then views these searched results also in pages of results products

2- I have also implemented tags search where user can see key words that are related or associated with 
certain product such as categories and click on the tag and it will return products related to the text 

3-warning message if search results are 9


4- I have implemented search on featured products and all products option as well

Task #3 view rates of product and allow rating for a product 
i have implemented javascript file that helps view rates on shape of stars for user in the catalog page and allows user 
to rate a product in the orderHisotry page.

Task #4 add to cart complete flow 
1- I have added add to cart button that fires a rest call to add the product to cart and goes back to the same page of 
product
2- warning messages that fades away with time if product was not added to cart for any reason

 Task #5 orderHistory Page 
1- I have prepared the frontend impelenation for orderHistory that fires a get api call to ger orders from user and 
display the orders and their product information


task#6 complete test for all catalog related functionalities and backend integration 
  testing results of catalog page and paginations in a pdf file in github


Task #7 :testing plans for this week 
1- Integration of orderHistory 
2- Payment page for creating an order
 
difficulties : 
pagination was a little bit tricky to implement as i needed to maintain the page number when i refresh to another page and 
offset the index of the list of products
implementing payment at this moment if we want to effect the status of orders or just create a confirmed order at once
these questions for this week to solve
