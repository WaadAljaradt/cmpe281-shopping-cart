Week #3

Configured Mongo three node replica Set using the amazon EC2 instance (Large)

Steps to configure:

1)Pull up a large instance of the the EC2 AMI in a VPC.
2)Configure the security group to use ports 22,27017 & 80.
3)Create a package using : /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-2.6.repo
4)Add this to use the yum install: 
[mongodb-org-2.6]
name=MongoDB 2.6 Repository
baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1 

5)Now install the mongodb and its associated tools by using the command: sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
6)Inorder to exclude the yum to update it automatically include thi line in /etc/yum.conf
exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools

7)Now in the configuration file of mongo which is at /etc/mongod.conf edit and use "replset=<some_name_string>"
8)Now use rs.initiate() to insitiate the replica set.
9)Repeat the same procedure for the other two nodes also excluding the step 8.
10)Now use rs.add(<internal_ip>) to add the other two nodes to the replica set.
11)Once added use rs.status() to show the status of the nodes. The output of the status is attached with this file named status.jpg
12)Now the mongo cluster is configured and is working.
