#week 2:

1)Configuring the mongo cluster using the replica sets on aws.

	a)Setup the 3 node cluster in the aws in different AZ's using subnet.
	b)On all the nodes check for the runnig mongod instances using : ps -eaf | grep 'mongod'
	c)Stop the mongod service.
	d)Now run the mongod using the following command on all the instances:
		mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /var/lib/mongo --replSet rs0
	e)Now connect to the mongo instance by issuing command 'mongo'
	f)To initiate the replica set use : rs.initiate()
	g)This will become the primary node. To add the other two nodes as secondary use:
		rs.add("<hostname><:port>")
	h)We can check the status of the replica set by issuing the command: rs.status()


2)Seeding the products database with the dummy data.

	a)Added a seed which can be configured through the server file.
	b)If the seed is true, then I have written the code to populate the mongodb with some dummy data.
	c)Have to move this based on the environment setup which can behave differently for dev and prod env.

3)Exposing the GET api for listing of all the products.
	
	a) Exposed an API on /products which will provide with the list of all the prodcuts.
	b) Have to extend this for searching based on the catogeries and tags.
	

TODO for next week: 
	a)Expose the API for the featured products.
	b)Expose the API for searching based on tags.
	c)Think of the usefull ways for incrementing and decrementing the stocks.
