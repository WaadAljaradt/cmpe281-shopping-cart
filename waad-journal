Week #1 :

Task#1 Setup and learn heroku toolbelt

1- Heroku and enviroment set-up :
In the beginning it was essential to start setting up the environment, I created an account with heroku 
and I have installed it in my mac as well I deployed the first nodejs sample application and save 
it in my dash-board.
next step was using heroku to deploy locally, therefore I downloaded nodejs and npm to install updates and 
needed packages such as express. after that I was able to deploy locally.

Task #3 Bootstrap and welcome page 

2- Bootstrap 
next step was creating our own git-hub project and start coding in this nodejs project, we were all able to 
connect to github and access the master project of the shopping cart. the next step for me as part of the 
front-end team is to look into bootstrap. i was able to deploy a demo sample that uses many features of bootstrap 
i followed an online tutorial “Bootstrap Tutorial for Beginners” with 6 lessons on using bootstrap the URL is kept 
in waffel for everyone to access . then i was able to deploy it using heroku and kept as a reference since it contained 
many features that i need.
