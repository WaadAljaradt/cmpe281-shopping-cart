Application Architecture


Front End - Heroku 
	1. One Instance
	2. Written in Angular JS , Bootstrap

Backend - AWS (EC2 Instance) 
	1. One Instance
	2. Written in Node JS
	3. Implements REST Calls to be used by Front end

Databases
	1. MongoDB
		a. Mongo Cluster (3 Replicas )
		b. Stores
			1) Product Catalog
			2) Orders
			3) User Profiles

	2. Riak

Above is the planned architecture as of now.

Future Possibilities :

1. Can scale out backend by adding 3 servers.
2. Redis Implementation(if backend is scaled out, we will need some persistent storage for user sessions)
	a. Stores
		1) User Sessions
